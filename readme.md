## Constraints
-------------------------------------------
- The application should work in Chrome 45+
- CSS, if used, must be separated into css files (i.e., no in-line CSS where it makes sense to segment).
- If you choose to load the files via content-type text/xml, an external XML parser library may be used - but give credit if you do.

## Evaluation Criteria
--------------------------------------------
- Your solution will be judged on the following criteria, with the most important listed first.
- 100% coverage of all features and constraints listed above.
- Code legibility.  This includes formatting, commenting, naming, and adherence to solid design patterns.
- Usability.  It doesn't need a fancy user interface, but ease of use will be a factor.
- Choice of technology - or lack thereof (libraries, frameworks, helpers, etc.)
- Error checking and error handling.
- Amount of time taken to return the assignment.
- Packaging and submission style.  You may submit this assignment via Git, JSfiddle, a tarball or zip, GitHub pages or any other means of submission you feel appropriate (though it is an evaluation criteria item).
- If you're feeling ambitious, I have the other 12 chapters' worth of docs at your request.  Allowing the user to switch chapters is powerful but not required for this assignment.
